## Assembly Guidelines

### Material Selection:
- **Structural parts**: PETG or ABS (3D printed)
- **Transparent parts**: Clear PETG or acrylic
- **Gaskets/Seals**: Food-grade silicone
- **Hardware**: Stainless steel screws and inserts

### Print Settings (for 3D printing):
- Layer height: 0.2mm for general parts, 0.1mm for Lego® interfaces
- Infill: 40% for structural parts, 20% for decorative
- Support: Tree supports for overhangs >45°
- Print temperature: PETG (240°C), ABS (230°C)

### Post-Processing:
1. Remove support material carefully
2. Sand Lego® connection points for smooth fit
3. Apply food-safe sealant to water-contact surfaces
4. Test fit all connections before final assembly
5. Install threaded inserts using heat-set method

## CAD Software Recommendations

## STL File Naming Convention

Use this naming structure for organization:
```
PL_[Component]_[Size]_[Version].stl
Example: PL_GrowPod_Small_v1.stl
         PL_BaseStand_32x32_v2.stl
         PL_Connector_Tjoint_v1.stl
```
